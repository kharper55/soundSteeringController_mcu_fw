    Details: Function prototypes, constants, preprocessor defs/macros for WiFi (802.11) peripheral
             All BT and networking features should be implemented with the PRO CPU core. 
             Make sure to use sdkConfig ESP IDF tool to include the driver interfaces in your project.
             
    Written using ESP-IDF v5.1.1 API. Built in 03/2025 using v5.1.2

/*
ESP-IDF currently supports two host stacks. The Bluedroid based stack (default) supports classic 
Bluetooth as well as BLE. On the other hand, Apache NimBLE based stack is BLE only. For users to make a choice:
    - For usecases involving classic Bluetooth as well as BLE, Bluedroid should be used.
    - For BLE-only usecases, using NimBLE is recommended. It is less demanding in terms of 
    code footprint and runtime memory, making it suitable for such scenarios.

Typical Pattern: Wi-Fi Provisioning Flow

    1. Boot into AP mode if no known Wi-Fi credentials.
    2. Host a captive portal (ESP-IDF supports this).
    3. User connects to ESP32 AP, enters Wi-Fi credentials.
    4. ESP32 saves credentials in NVS and reboots into STA mode.
    5. ESP32 connects to the userâ€™s Wi-Fi and serves the web page there.

ESP-IDF provides Wi-Fi provisioning libraries (wifi_provisioning component) with:

    - BLE or SoftAP-based setup
    - Captive portal
    - Secure credential storage
